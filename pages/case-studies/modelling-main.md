Time series modelling scenarios are designed for a time series analysis
that includes identification and estimation of an ARIMA model as well as
abnormal values and calendar effects. It is done by applying automatic
model identification procedures implemented in the pre-processing parts
of TRAMO/SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS. These scenarios enable an analysis
of the time series characteristics. There are two scenarios, *Advanced time
series analysis* and *Basic time series analysis*; they differ in terms
of user intervention, amount of an output produced and saving options.
