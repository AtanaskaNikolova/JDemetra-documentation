## 3.4. Tools

The *Tools menu* includes, among other functionalities, tools which are helpful for a graphical analysis of the time series. The *‘X-13ARIMA-SEATS Reference Manual’* (2015) strongly recom-mends studying a high resolution plot of the time series as it is helpful to get information about e.g. seasonal patterns, potential outliers and stochastic non-stationarity. Also the *‘ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment’* (2015) recommend carrying out a graphical analysis on both unadjusted data and the initial run of the seasonal adjustment software. In particular, the graphical analysis should consider: 

- The length of the series and a model span;  
- The presence of zeros, outliers or problems in the data;  
- The structure of the series: presence of a long term and cyclical movements, of a seasonal component, volatility etc.;  
- The presence of possible breaks in the seasonal behaviour;  
- The decomposition scheme (additive, multiplicative).

The *‘ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment’* (2015), recommend that this exercise should be per-formed and documented for the most important series to be adjusted at least once a year.

The following functionalities are available from the *Tools* menu:

**- Container** – includes several tools for displaying data in a time domain;
**- Spectral analysis** – contains tools for analysis of time series in a frequency domain;
**- Aggregation** – enables the user to investigate the graph of the sum of multiple time se-ries;
**- Differencing** – allows for inspection the first regular differences of the time series;
**- Spreadsheet profiler** – offers the Excel-type view of the XLS file imported to JDemetra+.
**- Plugins** – allows the installation and activation of plugins, which extend JDemetra+ functionalities.
**- Options** – presents the default interface settings and allows for their modification.


##### Footnotes

[^65]: The disturbance filter of Koopman is nearly as fast as the Burman’s solution. However, it does not provide the standard deviations of the estimates.
