The Statistical methods menu includes functionalities for modelling, analysis and seasonal ad-justment of a time series. They are divided into three groups:
* **Anomaly Detection** – allows for a purely automatic identification of regression effects;
* **Modelling** – enables time series modelling using the TRAMO and RegARIMA models; 
* **Seasonal adjustment** – intended for seasonal adjustment of the time series with the TRAMO/SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods.
