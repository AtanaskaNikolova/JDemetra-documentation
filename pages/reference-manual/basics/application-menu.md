The default JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after launching the program, is clearly divided into several panels. 
The key parts of the user interface are: 
* The [Providers](data-providers.html) window, which organises time series; 
* The [Workspace](workspace.html) window, which stores results generated by the software as well as settings used to create them; 
* A central empty zone for presenting the actual analyses further called the Results panel.
The majority of functionalities are available from the main menu of the 
application, which is situated at the very top of the main window. If 
the user moves the cursor to an entry in the main menu and clicks on the 
left mouse button, a drop-down menu will appear. Clicking on an entry in 
the drop-down menu selects the highlighted item.
