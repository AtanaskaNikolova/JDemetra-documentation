The default JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after launching the program, is clearly divided into several panels.

**JDemetra+ default view**

The key parts of the user interface are: 
* The [Providers](data-providers.html) window, which organises time series; 
* The [Workspace](workspace.html) window, which stores results generated by the software as well as settings used to create them; 
* A central empty zone for presenting the actual analyses further called the [Results](#results-panel) panel.
* The [main menu](#application-menu).

The majority of functionalities are available from the main menu of the 
application, which is situated at the very top of the main window. If 
the user moves the cursor to an entry in the main menu and clicks on the 
left mouse button, a drop-down menu will appear. Clicking on an entry in 
the drop-down menu selects the highlighted item.

The functions available in the main menu of the application are explained below.
 
 
### Results panel {#results-panel}
-------------

The empty zone on the right is a place where JDemetra+ displays various
windows (Figure 2.6). More than one window can be displayed at the same
time. Windows can overlap each other with the foremost window being in
focus or active. The active window has a darkened title bar. The windows
in the results panel can be arranged in many different ways, depending
on the user’s needs (item 3.5). The example below shows one of the
possible views of this panel. The results of the user’s analysis are
displayed in the respective windows. The picture below shows two panels
– a window containing seasonal adjustment results (upper panel) and the
other one containing an autoregressive spectrum (lower panel).
