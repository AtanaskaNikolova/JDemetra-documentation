The algorithms implemented in JDemetra+ enebles for a modelling the original time series with a RegARIMA model, 
including estimation of the regression effects such as outliers and calendar effects. These procedures can be 
used simply for the modelling and forecasting of the orignal time series as well as for a pre-treatment of the series, 
which aims to ensure a reliable estimation of the time series components performed by the seasonal adjustment procedures.


This section is divided into two parts: 
* [Specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html), which presents parameters of the modelling procedure.
* [Output](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html), which explains a typical output produced by the modelling procedure.
