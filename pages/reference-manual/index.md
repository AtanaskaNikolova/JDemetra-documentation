title: About JDemetra+ Reference Manual
---

The *Reference Manual* aims to guide the user through
the main features of JDemetra+ software and assist the user to take
advantage of this powerful tool. The *Reference Manual*
presents an overview of the capabilities of the software and
includes detailed documentation on all of the specifications, with
discussions of the available arguments and their default values. Also
the results displayed by JDemetra+ are elaborated. For a short introducion to JDemetra+ software the user should
refer to the [*Quick Start*](/quick-start/). A step-by-step
descriptions of how to perform a typical analysis and useful tips that
facilitate replication of the results with the userâ€™s own data and
working instructions are included in the [*Case Studies*](../case-studies) section.

JDemetra+ uses the notation "X12", "X13","Arima", "RegArima", "Tramo",
"Seats" and "TramoSeats" instead of "X-12-ARIMA", "X-13ARIMA-SEATS",
"ARIMA", "RegARIMA", "TRAMO", "SEATS" and "TRAMO/SEATS" respectively.
This notation is also used in this page only when the references to the user interface are made.

### Users to whom the *Referenced Manual* is intended {#users-to-whom-this-document-is-intended}

This section provide information useful for the beginners, i.e.
those who have only basic knowledge about the idea of seasonality and
its estimation in time series, and for the users who have already
acquired some experience from seasonal adjustment using relevant
software and are able to interpret the outcomes, at least on a basic
level.

The *Reference Manual* does not describe the detailed working of the seasonal
adjustment methods, nor the underlying mathematics. It assumes that the
reader has acquired a background knowledge on the concept of seasonal
adjustment and is familiar with the X-12-ARIMA, the X-13ARIMA-SEATS and
the TRAMO/SEATS methods. A brief outline of the X-12-ARIMA, the
X-13ARIMA-SEATS and the TRAMO/SEATS algorithms and concepts is included.
For readers interested in studying the seasonal adjustment methods
further, a bibliography is provided [here](../pages/references/).

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with concepts, such as
*stochastic and* *deterministic processes,* *time series*,
*trend-cycle*, *seasonality*, *descriptive statistics*, *confidence
level*, *mean square error*, *estimate*, *estimator*, *linear
regression, stationarity*, *ARIMA process* and so on. Readers with
insufficient background to follow this document are encouraged to refer
to an appropriate textbook, e.g. CHATFIELD (2004). Some background
knowledge about seasonality in the time series can be gained from the
e-learning courses on seasonal adjustment that are available [<span
class="underline">here</span>](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/e-learning-course-seasonal-adjustment_en).

### How the *Reference Manual* section is organised {#how-the-document-is-organised}

In the *Reference Manual* section the user can find:

- explanation of the purpose of the main windows: [Data providers](/reference-manual/data-providers.html) and [Workspace] (reference-manual/workspace.html)
- information on the (calendars)[../reference-manual/calendars.html] and user-defined
(regression variables)[../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html].
- discussion of the options implemented in the [application menu](../reference-manual/application-menu.html)
- presentation of the options for the [seasonal adjustment specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html) 
- discussion of the [results from the pre-defined and user-defined seasonal adjustment processes](../reference-manual/output.html).
