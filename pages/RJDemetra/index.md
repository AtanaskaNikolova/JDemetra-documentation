JDemetra+ can be used either as a stand-alone software with the graphical user interface on the NetBeans platform, or it can also be called through R with the dedicated package [RJDemetra](https://github.com/jdemetra/rjdemetra).

Most of the functionalities of the stand-alone version are also available through RJDemetra. Please refer to the GitHub page for installation instructions, examples, and documentation.
